Perfect — you're heading toward a production-grade cryptographic communication system. Let’s walk through each enhancement clearly, and I’ll provide guidance or code snippets as we go.

## 🔐 1. **Rotate Keys Per Session or Request**

### 🔸 Why?

Fresh keys = better forward secrecy. Even if one AES key is compromised, others remain safe.

### 🔸 What to do:

* **Client generates a new AES key + IV every request** (✅ you already do this).
* ✅ Good already: never reuse keys, and you don’t persist AES keys.
* If you want to go further:

  * Also **generate an ephemeral RSA keypair** per session for client → server reply signing (optional).

✅ You're already solid on key rotation with per-request AES.

## 🔏 2. **Sign Messages (RSA Digital Signature)**

### 🔸 Why?

To ensure the message **wasn't tampered with** and **was really from the sender**.

### 🔸 Steps:

#### 🔹 Client side:

```java
Signature rsaSign = Signature.getInstance("SHA256withRSA");
rsaSign.initSign(clientPrivateKey);  // You must have this key
rsaSign.update(encryptedDataBytes); // or original plaintext
byte[] signatureBytes = rsaSign.sign();
String signatureBase64 = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(signatureBytes);
```

* Add `signature` to your JSON payload:

```json
{
  "encryptedData": "...",
  "iv": "...",
  "encryptedKey": "...",
  "signature": "..."   ← Sign original/encrypted data
}
```

#### 🔹 Server side:

```java
Signature rsaVerify = Signature.getInstance("SHA256withRSA");
rsaVerify.initVerify(clientPublicKey); // Load from DB or PEM
rsaVerify.update(encryptedDataBytes);
boolean isValid = rsaVerify.verify(Base64.getDecoder().decode(signature));
```

Reject the request if `!isValid`.

## ⏱️ 3. **Use Key Expiry or Timestamp Validation**

### 🔸 Why?

Protects against replay attacks — someone reusing a captured request.

### 🔸 What to do:

* Add a `timestamp` to your request payload (e.g., ISO string or epoch milliseconds).

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-18T10:23:54Z"
}
```

* Include this in what you sign, so it can't be spoofed.

#### On the server:

* Parse timestamp and check:

```java
Duration.between(Instant.parse(timestamp), Instant.now()).abs().toMinutes() < 2
```

Reject anything outside your 2-minute tolerance.

## 🔄 4. **Build Full-Duplex Secure Communication (Client ↔ Server)**

### 🔸 Objective:

Not just client → server. Now server replies securely with:

* AES-encrypted data
* Signed response (using server’s private key)
* Optional timestamp

### 🔸 Server Response Structure:

```json
{
  "encryptedData": "...",
  "iv": "...",
  "signature": "...",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-18T10:25:00Z"
}
```

### 🔸 On client:

* Validate `timestamp` (check it’s fresh)
* Validate `signature` (using server’s public key)
* Then decrypt using AES key + IV

## 🧱 Putting It All Together (Hybrid Protocol Summary)

### 🔁 Request flow:

1. Client generates AES key + IV
2. Encrypts message with AES
3. Encrypts AES key with server’s public RSA key
4. Signs encryptedData + timestamp with client private key
5. Sends `encryptedData`, `iv`, `encryptedKey`, `timestamp`, `signature`

### ✅ Server:

* Verifies signature
* Checks timestamp freshness
* Decrypts AES key (RSA private)
* Decrypts message (AES key + IV)
* Processes message
* Creates response: `responseData`, `iv`, `timestamp`, `signature`
* Signs response with server private key
* Encrypts responseData with AES
* Sends response

---

## ✅ Optional Enhancements

* Use **nonce** (UUID/random) in payload to prevent replay
* Keep recent nonces/timestamps in memory or cache to detect duplicates
* Use **HMAC** on top of AES for additional message integrity check
* Store/rotate server RSA keys securely (e.g., JKS or Vault)
